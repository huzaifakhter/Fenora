## âš¡ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Astral UV
- LAN-connected devices for access

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/huzaifakhter/fenora.git
   cd fenora
   ```
2. **Run the batch file**
   ```bash
   run.bat
   ```
   This will ***sync*** the environment and install all the stuff used for **Fenora** to work.

3. **Access The App**
   ```bash
   Access Link: http://xx.xxx.xx.xxx:8000 - Share This Link With Your Teammates On The Same Network
   ```
   Now, anyone connected to the same network as the host computer can access the app in browser.
   
If you are not using uv, simply run:

``pip install -r requirements.txt
``

Then start the server from the root directory with:

``uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
``

This ensures your app is accessible to others on the same network. The ``--host 0.0.0.0`` option allows connections from any device on the network, and ``--port 8000`` sets the port.
